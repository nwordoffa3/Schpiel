# Schpiel

Hello everyone! Schpiel was a project made with inspirations from someone I met who works at 
a lab at vanderbilt (I need to get his name) and my innate laziness in inputting information.

With most job finding websites, they like to advertise "easy applying". Even with that there 
are many moments where these websites just take you to the companies' website and make you 
apply there. Schpiel, in idea, is supposed to help me (and other users) autofill these job applications. 

Schpiel as an app is built on ReactJs and hosted through github pages.
